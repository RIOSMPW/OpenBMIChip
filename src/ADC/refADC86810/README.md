A family of integrated data acquisition systems based on successive approximation (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).  These devices feature a high-speed, high-precision SAR ADC, integrated analog front-end (AFE) input driver circuitry, overvoltage protection up to Â±20V, and an on-chip  reference voltage of 4.096V with very low temperature drift.
